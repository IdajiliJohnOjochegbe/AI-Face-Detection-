# GenDetect: Real vs AI-Generated Face Classifier

GenDetect is a deep learning-powered tool designed to classify facial images as either **real** (captured from actual humans) or **AI-generated** (synthetically produced by generative models). This project blends transfer learning with advanced image analysis to tackle the rising concern of deepfakes and synthetic visual media.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Distinguishes between real and AI-generated face images
- 🔍 Uses MobileNet (pretrained on ImageNet) for feature extraction
- 🧠 Trains a lightweight neural network on extracted features
- 📊 Performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🛠️ Ready for deployment on the web
- 📁 Google Drive support for easy dataset access

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

- **Real Faces:** Collected from real-world photos
- **AI-Generated Faces:** Generated by synthetic image models

📎 [Access the dataset on Google Drive](YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_DATASET_LINK_HERE)

_All images are preprocessed to 128x128 resolution and balanced to avoid class bias._

## 🧠 Model Architecture

**Feature Extraction:**  
- MobileNet (without top classification layer)

**Classifier:**  
- Dense Neural Network:
  - Input from MobileNet features
  - 64 → 32 units (ReLU)
  - Dropout regularization
  - Output layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Sample visualization of real and AI faces  
- Histogram equalization and edge detection  
- Average pixel value correlation with class  
- Outlier detection  
- Class balance analysis  

EDA insights help verify data quality and model interpretability.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository or open in Colab

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([YOUR_GOOGLE_COLAB_NOTEBOOK_LINK_HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IdajiliJohnOjochegbe/AI-Face-Detection-/blob/main/Detect_AI_Face.ipynb#scrollTo=n3jyXHf_S3hU))

### 2. Mount Google Drive

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### 3. Run the notebook

After mounting your Google Drive, the notebook will walk you through:

- Loading real and AI-generated image datasets
- Resizing and preprocessing images
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extracting features using a pre-trained MobileNet model
- Training a binary classifier (neural network)
- Evaluating performance on unseen data
- Making predictions on new input images

All major packages like `TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `OpenCV`, and `PIL` are already available in Google Colab.

## 🔮 Predict on New Data

Once training is complete, you can test the model on any new image:

```python
# Path to the new image
new_image_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/your_test_image.jpg'
```
# Preprocess and extract features

```python
new_image_array = preprocess_image(new_image_path)

new_image_features = extract_features(new_image_array, feature_extraction_model)

new_image_features_flat = new_image_features.reshape((1, -1))
```
# Make prediction

```python
prediction = model.predict(new_image_features_flat)

predicted_class = "AI Generated" if prediction > 0.5 else "Real"

print(f'The new image is predicted to be: {predicted_class}')
```

## Deployment Plan

This model is designed for web deployment. Some recommended deployment strategies include:

Gradio or Streamlit: For creating an interactive web demo

Flask or FastAPI: For building an API backend to serve predictions

TensorFlow.js: If you prefer running the model in the browser (client-side)

The extracted model can be saved using:

```python
model.save("ai_face_classifier.h5")
```
You can then load it in your deployment script for inference.
